👤 Real-Time Face Recognition System using OpenCV
This project is a real-time face recognition system built with Python and OpenCV using the classical FisherFace algorithm for recognizing known faces via webcam. It's a beginner-friendly computer vision project that demonstrates face detection, training, and recognition in live video.

📌 Features
Detect faces in real-time using Haar Cascade.

Train on custom datasets organized by user folders.

Recognize known faces and label them with confidence scores.

Detect and log unknown persons by saving their image frames.

Easy to extend with more training data or better models (e.g., LBPH, Dlib, FaceNet).

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3.x

OpenCV (opencv-contrib-python)

NumPy

Haar Cascades (for face detection)

FisherFace Recognizer (for face recognition)
